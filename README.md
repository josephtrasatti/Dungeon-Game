# Dungeon-Game
Goal is to create a simple dungeon game for fun!

Program uses Pygame library to operate. After setting up the window and creating a character, I noticed some poor framerate. I found that other people experienced the same problem with Mac OS + Pygame. Setting project aside until I can find a workaround.
